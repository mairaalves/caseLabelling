## Doctor Case Label
This is the case labelling project. This project consists on a page that lets the user read a medical case and choose among a list of medical conditions which condition suits the medical case best and save this choice, called label, on the database. Each case that has been labeled has also the doctor id that labeled it.

A doctor first needs to login before start labelling cases. He/she can logout and login again at any times.
